        "DESCRIPTION": "As part of Understanding Risk Boulder, RNI developed a \"Tech Challenge\"  to provide $20k in seed funding to find innovative solutions using open source technology to improve resilience in Boulder and strengthen citizen engagement. Five finalists, whose ideas ranged from apps for better volunteer coordination, to urban climate change adaptation analysis, pitched their ideas to a juried panel. The winning submission is TrendsOnline: a community data dashboard created by the Community Foundation of Boulder and Code for Boulder, a local brigade of Code for America. TrendsOnline is a community indicators report that has been a valuable resource to nonprofits, government, business and residents in Boulder County but remains only available in print form. The new online version will complement the print edition by making allowing easier access to data, analysis, and provide a forum to convene government and residents about them. It will help identify the most pressing resilience needs in Boulder and help connect organizations and individuals to take collective action. TrendsOnline will provide open data and analysis through an online dashboard and apps. The code created to run the site will be open source, allowing any city to quickly and easily establish their own version of the dashboard. More information at http://bit.ly/1UlHpLk\n\nThe event itself was an important milestone for resilience in Boulder: as an open event, URB drew in more than 100 attendees from private sector, government, community-based organizations, researchers, and the general public. This provided a venue to share information and develop new partnerships. In a follow-up survey more than 80% of respondents felt that it URB was excellent for \"developing new partnerships\" and almost 90% found that it was an excellent event for knowledge exchange. Many attendees commented on the great environment for sharing and learning about resilience and hazards from new perspectives.",

This approach would be best suited for cities that have strong analytic capacity, whether in city government or in the local community. It's important that a pipeline such as this be curated by local stakeholders and continually added to. This is especially important when compiling hyper-local data streams such as prominent Twitter users, etc. Once established, the pipeline could be a valuable resource for local government, community analysts, but also for local journalists and researchers.

We are proposing to create an original pipeline of local resilience data in each city by using the technology behind CrisisNET (http://crisis.net). This pipeline will combine data from a wide range of sources and be publicly available. RNI will work directly with communities and CROs to build upon this pipeline for their own needs; produce analysis as a convening point for better decision-making; and turn this knowledge into action. The pipeline will also be available to all Rockefeller Grantees and partners to inform their program planning and or as an input to their analytical work or tools.",

Boulder has always been a progressive city with regards to sustainability and environmental stewardship. Now, as they recover from historic flooding in 2013 _ just three years after experiencing the state's most financially destructive wildfire in history _ Boulder is once again leaning forward to develop communications tools that will better connect the city to the needs of the citizens. This introductory meeting allowed us to learn more about Boulder's needs and begin brainstorming for the future. The City has already made some attempts at citizen engagement through technology but are looking for ways to increase participation. In my time in the area I've found a wide variety of existing, community-based, organizations that focus on nature and environmental causes. I believe that tapping into these existing groups will provide this increase.",

Because the creation of timely, accessible, geographic data is a critical need we met city officials and community based organizations who all use OpenStreetMap (OSM) at the annual ���State of the Map U.S.��� conference to see how community mapping might play a role in RNI. This shift in using on open, &quot;community-based&quot; platform for map data is still quite new and offers exciting new possibilities for transparency in government and greater citizen engagement. These valuable conversations lead to connections with OSM users in the cities we hope to support and connected us with a diverse range of groups interested in collaborating with our initiative.
