# Geocoded RNI Activities in GeoJSON
This repository contains a data folder with a complete list of geocoded activities that were completed as part of [Ushahidi](https://www.ushahidi.com)'s [Resilience Network Initiative](http://cityresilience.net/what-is-rni.html). All data were pulled from the [Ushahidi deployment for the Resilience Network Initiative](http://rni.ushahidi.com/) and are presented in the original .csv download format but have also been converted to GeoJSON. 

The [data folder](/data) contains:
* A polygon to denote the [boundaries of the neighborhood of Purwodinatan] (Data/Purwodinatan%20Neighborhood%20Project%20Area.geojson), which was the focus of our work in Semarang, Indonesia.
* Text: [Link...](url...). 
* Text: [Link...](url...). 

[GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/) is a great open standard format designed for representing simple geographical features, which also allows for [data to be previewed as a map via Github](https://help.github.com/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github/). Because Ushahidi deployments commonly offer .csv as a download default, I used [this tool] (http://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-geojson.htm) to convert .csv to GeoJSON. Mapbox also offers a [handy tool](http://mapbox.github.io/togeojson/) for converting .gpx files to GeoJSON.
