# RNI-Activity-Map
A complete list of geocoded activities that were completed as part of [Ushahidi](https://www.ushahidi.com)'s [Resilience Network Initiative](http://cityresilience.net/what-is-rni.html). All data were pulled from the [Ushahidi deployment for the Resilience Network Initiative](http://rni.ushahidi.com/) and have been converted here to GeoJSON. 

[GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/) is a great open standard format designed for representing simple geographical features, which also allows for [data to be previewed as a map via Github](https://help.github.com/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github/). Because Ushahidi deployments commonly offer .csv as a download default, I used http://togeojson.com to convert csv. GeoJSON. Mapbox also offers a handy tool for converting .gpx files to GeoJSON at http://mapbox.github.io/togeojson/
