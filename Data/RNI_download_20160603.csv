The project met the goals of the Rockefeller Foundation by demonstrably connecting citizens with city government: members of the project have been recruited to a city government steering committee for resilience and active social media exchanges between the city government and Peta Kota show consistent engagement. 

So far the project:
â—è Mapped 188,679 buildings in OpenStreetMap
â—è Created 551 reports/posts in the Ushahidi deployment: http://petasmg.com.
â—è Trained 13 people
â—è Produced an Indonesian training manual for use through the country: http://bit.ly/1TSQMUt.
 
The project made extensive use of innovative communications to increase citizen engagement: including neighborhood murals with URL and instructions for reporting; using large paper maps to collect analog reports for transfer to the deployment; and creating highly attended community events to launch the project.",RNI Activities,-6.972882,110.429455Peta Kota Wraps Up OSM Mapping in Prep for Ushahidi Launch!,8/10/15 18:34,Neighborhood of Purwodinatan,Grobak Hysteria has wrapped up a phenomenal OpenStreetMap effort and is prepared to launch their Ushahidi deployment at the end of August with a massive street festival Semarang!

These users are an important resource: they understand the technology and can be representatives of community groups, companies, or institutions that offer important insights to resilience. They may hold the key to instituting a new technology to promote citizen engagement or they may help identify unmet needs or resilience gaps within a city. At the Milan meet-up we were excited to have a wide range of attendees with representatives from:

- GeoBeyond, who provide geospatial services for businesses;
- the CIMA foundation: a non-profit research organization committed to research, development, and training in the fields of Civil Protection, Disaster Risk Reduction and Biodiversity
- The Urban and Regional Planning department of the Politecnico di Milano, who lead the KNOW4DRR project to explore how knowledge on disaster mitigation and adaptation is produced, shared, maintained, and used by a variety of stakeholders;
- GnuCOOP, who provide open-source IT solutions to NGOs and nonprofits; and

This approach would be best suited for cities that have strong analytic capacity, whether in city government or in the local community. Itâ€™s important that a pipeline such as this be curated by local stakeholders and continually added to. This is especially important when compiling hyper-local data streams such as prominent Twitter users, etc. Once established, the pipeline could be a valuable resource for local government, community analysts, but also for local journalists and researchers.

Boulder has always been a progressive city with regards to sustainability and environmental stewardship. Now, as they recover from historic flooding in 2013 â€“ just three years after experiencing the stateâ€™s most financially destructive wildfire in history â€“ Boulder is once again leaning forward to develop communications tools that will better connect the city to the needs of the citizens. This introductory meeting allowed us to learn more about Boulderâ€™s needs and begin brainstorming for the future. The City has already made some attempts at citizen engagement through technology but are looking for ways to increase participation. In my time in the area I've found a wide variety of existing, community-based, organizations that focus on nature and environmental causes.
