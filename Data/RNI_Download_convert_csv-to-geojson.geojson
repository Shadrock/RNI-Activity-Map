These users are an important resource: they understand the technology and can be representatives of community groups, companies, or institutions that offer important insights to resilience. They may hold the key to instituting a new technology to promote citizen engagement or they may help identify unmet needs or resilience gaps within a city. At the Milan meet-up we were excited to have a wide range of attendees with representatives from:\n\n- GeoBeyond, who provide geospatial services for businesses;\n- the CIMA foundation: a non-profit research organization committed to research, development, and training in the fields of Civil Protection, Disaster Risk Reduction and Biodiversity\n- The Urban and Regional Planning department of the Politecnico di Milano, who lead the KNOW4DRR project to explore how knowledge on disaster mitigation and adaptation is produced, shared, maintained, and used by a variety of stakeholders;\n- GnuCOOP, who provide open-source IT solutions to NGOs and nonprofits; and\n- representatives from the 100 Resilient Cities team in Milan.\n\nFor full write up see the news source link for this post.","CATEGORY":"RNI Activities","APPROVED":"YES","VERIFIED":"YES"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[110.3996,-7.007112]},"properties":{"INCIDENT TITLE":"Ushahidi Training for Hysteria","INCIDENT DATE":"7/9/15 12:02","LOCATION":"Hysteria Offices, Semarang, Indonesia","DESCRIPTION":"Grobak Hysteria has completed mapping the neighborhood of Purwodinatan and will now begin working with residents to submit reports about resilience challenges and capacity in their neighborhood.
