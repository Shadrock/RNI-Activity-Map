Five finalists, whose ideas ranged from apps for better volunteer coordination, to urban climate change adaptation analysis, pitched their ideas to a juried panel. The winning submission is TrendsOnline: a community data dashboard created by the Community Foundation of Boulder and Code for Boulder, a local brigade of Code for America. TrendsOnline is a community indicators report that has been a valuable resource to nonprofits, government, business and residents in Boulder County but remains only available in print form. The new online version will complement the print edition by making allowing easier access to data, analysis, and provide a forum to convene government and residents about them. It will help identify the most pressing resilience needs in Boulder and help connect organizations and individuals to take collective action. TrendsOnline will provide open data and analysis through an online dashboard and apps. The code created to run the site will be open source, allowing any city to quickly and easily establish their own version of the dashboard.

This provided a venue to share information and develop new partnerships. In a follow-up survey more than 80% of respondents felt that it URB was excellent for ""developing new partnerships"" and almost 90% found that it was an excellent event for knowledge exchange. Many attendees commented on the great environment for sharing and learning about resilience and hazards from new perspectives.",RNI Activities,40.002863,-105.263099,1Understanding Risk Boulder launches at the National Center for Atmospheric Research,10/23/15 18:00,"National Center for Atmospheric Research, Mesa Laboratory","RNI, together with the World Bank's Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery launched the Understanding Risk Boulder conference and Tech Challenge in Boulder, Colorado.

It's important that a pipeline such as this be curated by local stakeholders and continually added to. This is especially important when compiling hyper-local data streams such as prominent Twitter users, etc. Once established, the pipeline could be a valuable resource for local government, community analysts, but also for local journalists and researchers.
